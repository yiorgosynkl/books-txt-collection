BOOK: Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis

CHAPTER IV 

At daybreak I opened my eyes and saw Zorba sitting opposite me at the end of his bed 
with his legs tucked up; he was smoking and absorbed in deep meditation. His little 
round eyes were fixed on the fanlight in front of him, which the first gleam of day tinted 
milky white. His eyes were swollen and his unusually long, bare, scraggy neck was 
stretched out like the neck of a bird of prey. 

The previous evening I had retired early, leaving him alone with the old siren. 

T'm going/1 said. 'Enjoy yourself, Zorba, and good luck to you!' 

'Good night, boss/ Zorba replied. 'Let us settle our little affair. Good night, boss. Sleep 

tight.' 

Apparently they did settle their little affair, for in my sleep I seemed to hear muffled 
cooings, and for a time the neighbouring room shook and trembled. Then sleep 
overcame me again. A long while after midnight, Zorba entered barefoot and stretched 
himself on his bed, very gently, so as not to wake me. 

In the first light, there he was, gazing into the distance with his lack-lustre eyes. You 
could see he was still sunk in a sort of torpor, his temples were not yet freed from 
sleep. Calmly, fondly, he was letting himself drift on a shady current as thick as honey. 
The whole universe of earth, water, thoughts and men was slowly drifting towards a 
distant sea, and Zorba was drifting away with it, unresistingly, unquestioningly, and 
happy. 

The village began to be roused - there was a confused murmur of cocks, pigs, asses 
and men. I wanted to leap from my bed and cry: 'Heigh! Zorba! We've work to do 
today!' But I too felt a great happiness in delivering myself up, 
47 

silently, to the rosy transformation of sunrise. In those magic minutes the whole of life 
seems as light as down. The earth constantly changes shape in the wind, like a soft 
and billowy cloud. 

I stretched out my arm; I, too, felt like having a smoke. I took my pipe. I looked at it 
with emotion. It was a big and precious one, 'Made in England'. It was a present from 
my friend - the one who had greyish-green eyes and slender fingers. That was 
abroad, years ago. He had finished his studies and was leaving that evening for 
Greece. 'Give up cigarettes/ he said. 'You light one, you smoke half of it and throw the 
rest away. Your love only lasts a minute. It's disgraceful. You'd better take up a pipe. 
It's like a faithful spouse. When you go home, it'll be there, quietly waiting for you. 
You'll light it, you'll watch the smoke rising in the air -and you'll think of me!' 
It was noon. We were leaving the Berlin museum, where he had been to have one last 
look at his favourite painting -Rembrandt's Warrior, with his bronze helmet, emaciated 
cheeks and his dolorous and strong-willed expression. 'If ever in my life I perform an 
action worthy of a man,' he murmured, as he gazed at the implacable and desperate 
warrior, 'It will be to him I shall owe it.' 

We were in the museum courtyard, leaning against a pillar. In front of us was a bronze 
statue of a naked Amazon, riding a wild horse with indescribable grace. A little grey 
bird, a wagtail, perched for a moment on the Amazon's head, turned towards us, 
jerking up its tail, uttered two or three times a mocking cry, and flew away. 
I shuddered, looked at my friend and asked: 



'Did you hear that bird? It seemed to say something to us, then it flew away.' 

My friend smiled. '"It's a bird, let it sing; it's a bird let it speak/" he said, quoting a line 

from one of our popular ballads. 

How was it that at this moment, at daybreak on this Cre- 
48 

tan coast, such a memory should come into my head, together with that faithful verse, 
and fill my mind with bitterness? 

I slowly worked some tobacco into my pipe and lit it. Everything in this world has a 
hidden meaning, I thought. Men, animals, trees, stars, they are all hieroglyphics; woe 
to any one who begins to decipher them and guess what they mean ... When you see 
them, you do not understand them. You think they are really men, animals, trees, 
stars. It is only years later, too late, that you understand ... 

The bronze-helmeted warrior, my friend leaning against the pillar, the wagtail and what 
it chirped to us, the verse from that melancholy ballad, all this, I thought today, may 
have a hidden meaning, but what can it be? 

My eyes followed the smoke which curled and uncurled in the dappled light. And my 
mind mingled with the smoke and slowly vanished in blue wreaths. After a long 
interval, without having any recourse to logic, I could see with utter certainty the origin, 
the growth and the disappearance of the world. It was as if I had once more plunged 
into Buddha, but this time without the delusive words and insolent acrobatic tricks of 
the mind. This smoke is the essence of his teaching, these vanishing spirals are life 
coming impatiently to a happy end in blue nirvana ... 

I sighed softly. As if this sigh had brought me back to the present minute, I looked 
round and saw the miserable wooden hut, and hanging on the wall a little mirror from 
which the first rays of the sun had just struck sparks. Opposite me, Zorba sat on his 
mattress, smoking, with his back to me. 

The previous day, with its tragi-comic fortunes, suddenly flashed into my mind. The 
smell of stale violet perfume - violet, eau-de-Cologne, musk and patchouli; a parrot, an 
almost human being transformed into a parrot and who beat his wings against the iron 
bars of his cage, calling the name of a former lover; and an old 
49 

Mahone,* only survivor of a whole fleet, who recounted ancient naval battles ... 
Zorba heard my sigh, shook his head and looked around. 

'We've behaved badly,' he murmured. 'We've behaved badly, boss. You laughed, so 
did I, and she saw us. And the way you left, without any fine words, as if she was an 
old bag of a hundred. What a damn shame! It's not polite, boss. That's not the way for 
a man to behave, let me tell you. She's a woman, after all, isn't she? A weak, fretful 
creature. A good job I stayed behind to console her.' 

'But what do you mean, Zorba?' I replied. 'Do you seriously think all women have 
nothing else but that in mind?' 

'Yes, boss, they've nothing else in mind. Listen to me, now ... I've seen all sorts, and 
I've done all kinds of things ... A woman has nothing else in view. She's a sickly 
creature, I tell you, and fretful. If you don't tell her you love and want her, she starts 
crying. Maybe she doesn't want you at all, maybe you disgust her, maybe she says 
no. That's another story. But all men who see her must desire her. That's what she 
wants, the poor creature, so you might try and please her! 

'I had a grandmother, she must have been eighty. What a tale that old soul's life would 
make! Never mind, that's another story, too ... Well, she must have been eighty in the 
shade, and opposite our house lived a young girl as fresh as a flower ... Krystallo she 
was called. Every Saturday evening, raw young bloods of the village would meet for a 
drink, and the wine made us lively. We stuck a sprig of basil behind our ears, one of 
my cousins took his guitar, and we went serenading. What love! What passion! We 
bellowed like bulls! We all wanted her, and every Saturday we went in a herd for her 
to make her choice. 



'Well, would you believe it, boss? It's a mystery! Women have a wound which never 
heals. Every wound heals but 

* Here a coasting vessel with sails. This name is also used for barges and formerly 

galleys. It comes from the Arabic, Ma'on. 

50 

that one - don't you take any notice of your books - that one never heals. What, just 
because a woman's eighty? The wound's still open. 

'So every Saturday the old girl pulled her mattress up to the window, took out her little 
mirror and combed away at the little bits of thatch she had left, and carefully made a 
parting. She'd look round slyly, for fear someone saw her. If anyone came near, she'd 
snuggle back and look as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, pretending she was 
dozing. But how could she sleep? She was waiting for the serenade. At eighty! You 
see what a mystery woman is, boss! Just now it makes me want to cry. But at that 
time I was just harum-scarum, I didn't understand and it made me laugh. One day I 
got annoyed with her. She was hauling me over the coals because I was running after 
the girls, so I told her straight out where to get off: "Why do you rub walnut leaves over 
your lips every Saturday, and part your hair? I s'pose you think we come to serenade 
you? It's Krystallo we're after. You're just a stinking old corpse!" 
'Would you believe it, boss! That day was the first time I knew what a woman was. 
Two tears sprang into my grandma's eyes. She curled up like a dog, and her chin 
trembled. "Krystallo!" I shouted, going nearer so as she'd hear better. "Krystallo!" 
Young people are cruel beasts, they're inhuman, they don't understand. My grandma 
raised her skinny arms to heaven. "Curse you from the bottom of my heart!" she cried. 
That very day she started to go into a decline. She wasted away and two months later, 
her days were numbered. Then when she was at her last gasp she saw me. She 
hissed like a turtle and tried to grab me with her withered fingers. "It was you who 
finished me off. May you be damned, Alexis, and suffer all I have!'" 
Zorba smiled. 

'Ah, the old witch's curse has hit home!' he said, stroking his moustache. 'I'm in my 

sixty-fifth year, I think, but even if I live to a hundred I'll never lay off. I'll still have a little 

mirror in my pocket, and I'll still be running after the female of the species.' 

He smiled once more, threw his cigarette through the fanlight, stretched his arms and 

said: 

'I've plenty of other faults, but that is the one that'll kill me.' 
He leapt from his bed. 

'Enough of all that. Cut the cackle. Today we work!' 

He dressed in a twinkling, put on his shoes and went out. 

With my head bowed, I ruminated on Zorba's words, and suddenly a distant snow- 
bound town came to my mind. I was at an exhibition of Rodin's works, and I had 
stopped to look at an enormous bronze hand, 'The Hand of God.' This hand was half 
closed, and in the palm an ecstatic man and woman were embracing and struggling. 
A girl came up and stopped beside me. She also looked and was moved at the 
disquieting, eternal embrace of man and woman. She was slim, well-dressed, she had 
a wealth of fair hair, a powerful chin and thin lips. There was something determined 
and virile about her. I normally hate inviting a conversation, and I do not know what 
urged me to turn to her and ask: 
'What are you thinking about?' 
'If only we could escape!' she murmured resentfully. 

'And go where? The hand of God is everywhere. There is no salvation. Are you 
sorry?' 

'No. Love may be the most intense joy on earth. It may be. But, now I see that bronze 
hand, I want to escape.' 
'You prefer freedom.' 



•Yes: 

'But, supposing it's only when we obey that bronze hand we are free? Supposing the 
word "God" didn't have that convenient meaning the masses give it?' 
She looked anxiously at me. Her eyes were of a metallic grey, her lips dry and bitter. 
'I don't understand,' she said, and moved away. 

She disappeared. Since then I had never thought any more of her. Nevertheless, she 
must have continued to live deep down in my heart, and today, on this empty coast, 
she reappeared, pale and plaintive, from the depths of my being. 
Yes, I had behaved badly. Zorba was right. That bronze hand was a good pretext. The 
first contact had succeeded, the first gentle words had been exchanged, and we might 
gradually, imperceptibly, have embraced and been united, undisturbed, in the hand of 
God. But I had suddenly darted from earth to heaven, and the woman had been 
startled and had fled. 

The old cock was crowing in Dame Hortense's yard. The white light of day was now 
peeping in through the little window. I leapt out of bed. 

The workmen had begun to arrive with their pickaxes, their crowbars and their 
mattocks. I heard Zorba giving his orders. He had thrown himself into the work straight 
away. One felt he was a man who knew how to command men, who loved 
responsibility. 

I put my head out of the fanlight and saw him standing, like a great gawk in the middle 
of thirty-odd lean, narrow-waisted, rough and weather-beaten men. His arm was 
stretched out authoritatively, his words were brief and to the point. Once he caught 
hold of a youngish fellow by the scruff of the neck because he was muttering and 
coming forward hesitatingly. 

'Got something to say, have you?' Zorba cried. 'Well, say it out aloud! I don't like 
mumblings. You've got to be in the mood to work. If you're not, get back to the tavern!' 
At that moment Dame Hortense appeared with tousled hair and swollen cheeks. She 
was not made up, and she was dressed in a full, dirty gown and was shuffling along in 
a pair of long, down-at-heel slippers. She coughed the raucous cough of old singers, 
like a donkey's braying. She stopped and looked with pride at Zorba. Her eyes 
became misty. She coughed again, so that he would notice her, and passed close 
53 

to him, swaying and wriggling her hips. Her broad sleeve almost brushed him. But he 
did not even turn round to look at her. He took a piece of barley cake and a handful of 
olives from a workman and shouted: 

'Now, men, in God's name, make the sign of the cross!' And, striding away, he led the 
gang in a beeline towards the mountain. 

I shall not describe here the work on the mine. It would need patience to do that, and I 
have none. Near the sea, we built a hut out of bamboo, osier and petrol-cans. Zorba 
used to awake at dawn, seize his pick, go to the mine before the men, open a gallery, 
abandon it, find a gleaming lignite seam and dance for joy. But after a few days he 
would lose the seam and he would fling himself down on the ground with his legs in 
the air and, with his feet and hands, make a mocking gesture at the sky. 
He had taken to the work. He no longer even consulted me. From the very first days 
all the care and responsibility had passed from my hands to his. His job was to make 
decisions and put them into execution. Mine was to pay the piper. This arrangement, 
moreover, suited me fairly well. For I sensed that these months would be the happiest 
in my life. Also, everything considered, I felt I was buying my happiness cheaply. 
My maternal grandfather, who lived in a fair-sized Cretan village, used to take his 
lantern every evening and go round the streets to see if, by chance, any stranger had 
arrived. He would take him to his house and give him an abundance of food and drink, 
after which he would sit on his divan, light his long Turkish pipe, his chibouk, and turn 
to his guest -for whom the time had come to repay the hospitality - and say in a 
peremptory tone: 



Talk!' 

'Talk about what, Father Moustoyorgi?' 

'What you are, who you are, where you come from, what 

54 

towns and villages you have seen - everything, tell me everything. Now, speak!' 
And the guest would begin to talk at random, uttering truths and falsehoods, whilst my 
grandfather, sitting calmly on his divan, smoked his chibouk, listening intently and fol- 
lowing the stranger in his travels. And if he liked the guest, he would say: 
'You shall stay tomorrow too. You're not going. You've still things to tell.' 
My grandfather had never left his village. He had never been even to Candia or 
Canea. 'Why go there?' he would say. "There are Candians and Caneans, peace be 
with them, who pass here - Candia and Canea come to me, so why need I go to 
them?' 

On this Cretan coast today I am perpetuating my grandfather's mania. I have also 
found a guest by the light of my lantern. I do not let him depart. He costs me far more 
than a dinner, but he is worth it. Every evening I wait for him after work, I make him sit 
opposite me and we eat. The time comes when he must pay, and T say to him: Talk!' I 
smoke my pipe and I listen. This guest has thoroughly explored the earth and the 
human soul. I never tire of listening to him. 
Talk, Zorba, talk!' 

When he speaks, the whole of Macedonia is immediately spread before my gaze, laid 
out in the little space between Zorba and myself, with its mountains, its forests, its 
torrents, its comitadjis, its hard-working women and great, heavily-built men. And also 
Mount Athos with its twenty-one monasteries, its arsenals and its broad-bottomed 
idlers. Zorba would shake his head as he finished his tales of monks and say, roaring 
with laughter: 'God preserve you, boss, from the stern of mules and the stem of 
monks!' 

Every evening Zorba takes me through Greece, Bulgaria and Constantinople. I shut 
my eyes and I see. He has been all over the racked and chaotic Balkans and 
observed everything with his little falcon-like eyes, which he constantly 
55 

opens wide in amazement. Things we are accustomed to, and which we pass by 
indifferently, suddenly rise up in front of Zorba like fearful enigmas. Seeing a woman 
pass by, he stops in consternation. 

'What is that mystery?' he asks. 'What is a woman, and why does she turn our heads? 
Just tell me, I ask you, what's the meaning of that?' 

He interrogates himself with the same amazement when he sees a man, a tree in 
blossom, a glass of cold water. Zorba sees everything every day as if for the first time. 
We .were sitting yesterday in front of the hut. When he had drunk a glass of wine, he 
turned to me in alarm: 

'Now whatever is this red water, boss, just tell me! An old stock grows branches, and 
at first there's nothing but a sour bunch of beads hanging down. Time passes, the sun 
ripens them, they become as sweet as honey, and then they're called grapes. We 
trample on them; we extract the juice and put it into casks; it ferments on its own, we 
open it on the feast-day of St. John-the-Drinker*, it's become wine! It's a miracle! You 
drink the red juice and, lo and behold, your soul grows big, too big for the old carcass, 
it challenges God to a fight. Now tell me, boss, how does it happen?' 
I did not answer. I felt, as I listened to Zorba, that the world was recovering its pristine 
freshness. All the dulled daily things regained the brightness they had in the begin- 
ning, when we came out of the hands of God. Water, women, the stars, bread, 
returned to their mysterious, primitive origin and the divine whirlwind burst once more 
upon the air. 

That is why, every evening, lying on the pebbles, I impatiently waited for Zorba. I 



would see him suddenly emerge out of the bowels of the earth and approach with his 

loose-knit body and long striding step. From afar I could see 

* The feast of Klydonas, held on the i$th August. It can be compared to Hallowe'en. 

56 

how the work had fared that day, by his bearing, by the way he held his head high or 
low, by the swing of his arms. 

At first I also went with him. I watched the men. I endeavoured to lead a different type 

of life, to interest myself in practical work, to know and love the human material which 

had fallen into my hands, to feel the long-wished-for joy of no longer having to deal 

with words but with living men. And I made romantic plans - if the extraction of lignite 

was successful - to organise a sort of community in which everything should be 

shared, where we should eat the same food together and wear the same clothes, like 

brothers. I created in my mind a new religious order, the leaven of a new life... 

But I had not yet made up my mind to acquaint Zorba with my project. He was irritated 

by my comings and goings amongst the workmen, questioning, interfering and always 

taking the workman's part. 

Zorba would purse his lips and say: 

'Boss, aren't you going for a stroll outside? The sun and the sea, you know!' 
At first I insisted, and would not go. I asked questions, gossiped, and got to know 
every man's history - how many children they had to feed, sisters to be married, 
helpless old relations; their cares, illnesses and worries. 

'Don't delve like that into their histories, boss,' Zorba would say, scowling. 'You'll be 
taken in, with your soft heart, and you'll like them more than's good for them or for our 
work. Whatever they do, you'll find excuses for them. Then, heaven help us, they'll 
scamp their work, do it any old how. Heaven help them, too, you'd better realise that. 
When the boss is hard, the men respect him, they work. When the boss is soft, they 
leave it all to him, and have an easy time, Get me?' 

Another evening, after work, he threw his pick down in the shed and shouted, out of all 
patience: 

'Look here, boss, do stop meddling. As fast as I build, you destroy. Now what are all 

those things you were telling them

'Look here, boss, do stop meddling. As fast as I build, you destroy. Now what are all 

those things you were telling them 

57 

tell you that? I don't believe in anything or any one; only in Zorba. Not because Zorba 
is better than the others; not at all, not a little bit! He's a brute like the rest! But I 
believe in Zorba because he's the only being I have in my power, the only one I know. 
All the rest are ghosts. I see with these eyes, I hear with these ears, I digest with 
these guts. All the rest are ghosts, I tell you. When I die, everything'll die. The whole 
Zorbatic world will go to the bottom!' 'What egoism!' I said sarcastically. 
'I can't help it, boss! That's how it is. I eat beans, I talk beans; I am Zorba, I talk like 
Zorba.' 

I said nothing. Zorba's words stung me like whiplashes. I admired him for being so 
strong, for despising men to that extent, and at the same time wanting to live and work 
with them. I should either have become an ascetic or else have adorned men with 
false feathers so that I could put up with them. 

Zorba looked round at me. By the light of the stars I could see he was grinning from 
ear to ear. 

'Have I offended you, boss?' he said, stopping abruptly. We had arrived at the hut. 
Zorba looked at me tenderly and uneasily. 

I did not reply. I felt my mind was in agreement with Zorba, but my heart resisted, 
wanted to leap out and escape from the brute, to go its own road. 
T'm not sleepy this evening, Zorba,' I said. 'You go to bed.' The stars were shining, the 
sea was sighing and licking the shells, a glow-worm lit under its belly its little erotic 
lantern. Night's hair was streaming with dew. 



I lay face downward, plunged in silence, thinking of nothing. I was now one with night 
and the sea; my mind was like a glowworm that had lit its little lantern and settled on 
the damp, dark earth, and was waiting. 

The stars were travelling round, the hours were passing -and, when I arose, I had, 
without knowing how, engraved on my mind the double task I had to accomplish on 
this shore: 
60 

Escape from Buddha, rid myself by words of all my metaphysical cares and free my 
mind from vain anxiety; 

Make direct and firm contact with men, starting from this very moment. 
I said to myself: 'Perhaps it is not yet too late.'
