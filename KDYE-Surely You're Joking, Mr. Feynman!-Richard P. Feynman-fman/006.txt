Alfred Nobel's Other Mistake 

In Canada they have a big association of physics students. They have meetings; 
they give papers, and so on. One time the Vancouver chapter wanted to have me come 
and talk to them. The girl in charge of it arranged with my secretary to fly all the way to 
Los Angeles without telling me. She just walked into my office. She was really cute, a 
beautiful blonde. (That helped; it's not supposed to, but it did.) And I was impressed that 
the students in Vancouver had financed the whole thing. They treated me so nicely in 
Vancouver that now I know the secret of how to really be entertained and give talks: Wait 
for the students to ask you. 

One time, a few years after I had won the Nobel Prize, some kids from the Irvine 
students' physics club came around and wanted me to talk. I said, "I’d love to do it. What 
I want to do is talk just to the physics club. But — I don’t want to be immodest — I've 
learned from experience that there’ll be trouble." 

I told them how I used to go over to a local high school every year to talk to the 
physics club about relativity, or whatever they asked about. Then, after I got the Prize, I 
went over there again, as usual, with no preparation, and they stuck me in front of an 
assembly of three hundred kids. 

It was a mess! 



I got that shock about three or four times, being an idiot and not catching on right 
away. When I was invited to Berkeley to give a talk on something in physics, I prepared 
something rather technical, expecting to give it to the usual physics department group. 

But when I got there, this tremendous lecture hall is full of people! And I know there's not 
that many people in Berkeley who know the level at which I prepared my talk. My 
problem is, I like to please the people who come to hear me, and I can't do it if everybody 
and his brother wants to hear: I don’t know my audience then. 

After the students understood that I can't just easily go over somewhere and give a 
talk to the physics club, I said, "Let's cook up a dull-sounding title and a dull-sounding 
professor's name, and then only the kids who are really interested in physics will bother 
to come, and those are the ones we want, OK? You don't have to sell anything." 

A few posters appeared on the Irvine campus: Professor Henry Warren from the 
University of Washington is going to talk about the structure of the proton on May 17th 
at 3:00 in Room D102. 

Then I came and said, "Professor Warren had some personal difficulties and was 
unable to come and speak to you today, so he telephoned me and asked me if I would talk 
to you about the subject, since I've been doing some work in the field. So here I am." It 
worked great. 

But then, somehow or other, the faculty adviser of the club found out about the 
trick, and he got very angry at them. He said, "You know, if it were known that Professor 
Feynman was coming down here, a lot of people would l ik e to have listened to him." 

The students explained, "That’s just it!" But the adviser was mad that he hadn’t 
been allowed in on the joke. 

Hearing that the students were in real trouble, I decided to write a letter to the 
adviser and explained that it was all my fault, that I wouldn’t have given the talk unless 
this arrangement had been made; that I had told the students not to tell anyone; I'm very 
sorry; please excuse me, blah, blah, blah. . . That’s the kind of stuff I have to go through 
on account of that damn prize! 

Just last year I was invited by the students at the University of Alaska in 
Fairbanks to talk, and had a wonderful time, except for the interviews on local television. 

I don’t need interviews; there's no point to it. I came to talk to the physics students, and 
that's it. If everybody in town wants to know that, let the school newspaper tell them. It's 
on account of the Nobel Prize that I've got to have an interview — I'm a big shot, right? 

A friend of mine who's a rich man — he invented some kind of simple digital 
switch — tells me about these people who contribute money to make prizes or give 
lectures: "You always look at them carefully to find out what crockery they're trying to 
absolve their conscience of." 

My friend Matt Sands was once going to write a book to be called Alfred Nobel’s 
Other Mistake. 

For many years I would look, when the time was coming around to give out the 
Prize, at who might get it. But after a while I wasn’t even aware of when it was the right 
"season." I therefore had no idea why someone would be calling me at 3:30 or 4:00 in the 
morning. "Professor Feynman?" 

"Hey! Why are you bothering me at this time in the morning?" 

"I thought you’d l ik e to know that you've won the Nobel Prize." 

"Yeah, but I'm sleeping! It would have been better if you had called me in the 



morning."— and I hung up. 

My wife said, "Who was that?" 

"They told me I won the Nobel Prize." 

"Oh, Richard, who was it?" I often kid around and she is so smart that she never 
gets fooled, but this time I caught her. 

The phone rings again: "Professor Feynman, have you heard. . ." 

(In a disappointed voice) "Yeah." 

Then I began to think, "How can I turn this all off? I don’t want any of this!" So 
the first thing was to take the telephone off the hook, because calls were coming one right 
after the other. I tried to go back to sleep, but found it was impossible. 

I went down to the study to think: What am I going to do? Maybe I won't accept 
the Prize. What would happen then? Maybe that's impossible. 

I put the receiver back on the hook and the phone rang right away. It was a guy 
from Time magazine. I said to him, "Listen, I've got a problem, so I want this off the 
record. I don’t know how to get out of this thing. Is there some way not to accept the 
Prize?" 

He said, "I'm afraid, sir, that there isn't any way you can do it without making 
more of a fuss than if you leave it alone." It was obvious. We had quite a conversation, 
about fifteen or twenty minutes, and the Time guy never published anything about it. 

I said thank you very much to the Time guy and hung up. The phone rang 
immediately: it was the newspaper. 

"Yes, you can come up to the house. Yes, it's all right. Yes, Yes, Yes.. ." 

One of the phone calls was a guy from the Swedish consulate. He was going to 
have a reception in Los Angeles. I figured that since I decided to accept the Prize, I've got 
to go through with all this stuff. 

The consul said, "Make a list of the people you would like to invite, and we’ll 
make a list of the people we are inviting. Then I'll come to your office and we'll compare 
the lists to see if there are any duplicates, and we'll make up the invitations. . ." 

So I made up my list. It had about eight people — my neighbor from across the 
street, my artist friend Zorthian, and so on. 

The consul came over to my office with his list: the Governor of the State of 
California, the This, the That; Getty, the oilman; some actress — it had three hundred 
people! And, needless to say, there was no duplication whatsoever! 

Then I began to get a little bit nervous. The idea of meeting all these dignitaries 
frightened me. 

The consul saw I was worried. "Oh, don't worry," he said. "Most of them don’t 

come." 

Well, I had never arranged a party that I invited people to, and knew to expect 
them not to come! I don’t have to kowtow to anybody and give them the delight of being 
honored with this invitation that they can refuse; it's stupid! By the time I got home I was 
really upset with the whole thing. I called the consul back and said, "I've thought it over, 
and I realize that I just can't go through with the reception." He was delighted. He said, 
"You're perfectly right." I think he was in the same position — having to set up a party for 
this jerk was just a pain in the ass. It turned out, in the end, everybody was happy. 

Nobody wanted to come, including the guest of honor! The host was much better off, too! 

I had a certain psychological difficulty all the way through this period. You see, I 



had been brought up by my father against royalty and pomp (he was in the uniforms 
business, so he knew the difference between a man with a uniform on, and with the 
uniform off — it's the same man). I had actually learned to ridicule this stuff all my life, 
and it was so strong and deeply cut into me that I couldn’t go up to a king without some 
strain. It was childish, I know, but I was brought up that way, so it was a problem. 

People told me that there was a rule in Sweden that after you accept the Prize, you 
have to back away from the king without turning around. You come down some steps, 
accept the Prize, and then go back up the steps. So I said to myself, "All right, I'm gonna 
fix them!" — and I practiced jumping up stairs, backwards, to show how ridiculous their 
custom was. I was in a terrible mood! That was stupid and silly, of course. I found out 
this wasn’t a rule any more; you could turn around when you left the king, and walk like a 
normal human being, in the direction you were intending to go, with your nose in front. 

I was pleased to find that not all the people in Sweden take the royal ceremonies 
as seriously as you might think. When you get there, you discover that they're on your 
side. The students had, for example, a special ceremony in which they granted each 
Nobel-Prize-winner the special "Order of the Frog." When you get this little frog, you 
have to make a frog noise. 

When I was younger I was anti-culture, but my father had some good books 
around. One was a book with the old Greek play The Frogs in it, and I glanced at it one 
time and I saw in there that a frog talks. It was written as "brek, kek, kek." I thought, "No 
frog ever made a sound like that; that's a crazy way to describe it!" so I tried it, and after 
practicing it awhile, I realized that it's very accurately what a frog says. 

So my chance glance into a book by Aristophanes turned out to be useful, later 
on: I could make a good frog noise at the students' ceremony for the Nobel-Prize- 
winners! And jumping backwards fit right in, too. So I liked that part of it; that ceremony 
went well. 

While I had a lot of fun, I did still have this psychological difficulty all the way 
through. My greatest problem was the Thank-You speech that you give at the King's 
Dinner. When they give you the Prize they give you some nicely bound books about the 
years before, and they have all the Thank-You speeches written out as if they're some big 
deal. So you begin to think it's of some importance what you say in this Thank-You 
speech, because it's going to be published. What I didn’t realize was that hardly anyone 
was going to listen to it carefully, and nobody was going to read it! I had lost my sense of 
proportion: I couldn’t just say thank you very much, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah; it would 
have been so easy to do that, but no, I have to make it honest. And the truth was, I didn’t 
really want this Prize, so how do I say thank you when I don't want it? 

My wife says I was a nervous wreck, worrying about what I was going to say in 
the speech, but I finally figured out a way to make a perfectly satisfactory-sounding 
speech that was nevertheless completely honest. I'm sure those who heard the speech had 
no idea what this guy had gone through in preparing it. 

I started out by saying that I had already received my prize in the pleasure I got in 
discovering what I did, from the fact that others used my work, and so on. I tried to 
explain that I had already received everything I expected to get, and the rest was nothing 
compared to it. I had already received my prize. 

But then I said I received, all at once, a big pile of letters — I said it much better in 
the speech — reminding me of all these people that I knew: letters from childhood friends 



who jumped up when they read the morning newspaper and cried out, "I know him! He's 
that kid we used to play with!" and so on; letters like that, which were very supportive 
and expressed what I interpreted as a kind of love. For that I thanked them. 

The speech went fine, but I was always getting into slight difficulties with royalty. 
During the King's Dinner I was sitting next to a princess who had gone to college in the 
United States. I assumed, incorrectly, that she had the same attitudes as I did. I figured 
she was just a kid like everybody else. I remarked on how the king and all the royalty had 
to stand for such a long time, shaking hands with all the guests at the reception before the 
dinner. "In America," I said, "we could make this more efficient. We would design a 
machine to shake hands." 

"Yes, but there wouldn’t be very much of a market for it here," she said, uneasily. 
"There's not that much royalty." 

"On the contrary, there’d be a very big market. At first, only the king would have 
a machine, and we could give it to him free. Then, of course, other people would want a 
machine, too. The question now becomes, who will be allowed to have a machine? The 
prime minister is permitted to buy one; then the president of the senate is allowed to buy 
one, and then the most important senior deputies. So there's a very big, expanding 
market, and pretty soon, you wouldn’t have to go through the reception line to shake 
hands with the machines; you'd send your machine!" 

I also sat next to the lady who was in charge of organizing the dinner. A waitress 
came by to fill my wineglass, and I said, "No, thank you. I don’t drink." 

The lady said, "No, no. Let her pour the drink." 

"But I don’t drink." 

She said, "It’s all right. Just look. You see, she has two bottles. We know that 
number eighty-eight doesn't drink." (Number eighty-eight was on the back of my chair.) 
"They look exactly the same, but one has no alcohol." 

"But how do you know?" I exclaimed. 

She smiled. "Now watch the king," she said. "He doesn’t drink either." 

She told me some of the problems they had had this particular year. One of them 
was, where should the Russian ambassador sit? The problem always is, at dinners like 
this, who sits nearer to the king. The Prize-winners normally sit closer to the king than 
the diplomatic corps does. And the order in which the diplomats sit is determined 
according to the length of time they have been in Sweden. Now at that time, the United 
States ambassador had been in Sweden longer than the Russian ambassador. But that 
year, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature was Mr. Sholokhov, a Russian, and the 
Russian ambassador wanted to be Mr. Sholokhov's translator — and therefore to sit next 
to him. So the problem was how to let the Russian ambassador sit closer to the king 
without offending the United States ambassador and the rest of the diplomatic corps. 

She said, "You should have seen what a fuss they went through — letters back and 
forth, telephone calls, and so on — before I ever got permission to have the ambassador sit 
next to Mr. Sholokhov. It was finally agreed that the ambassador wouldn’t officially 
represent the embassy of the Soviet Union that evening; rather, he was to be only the 
translator for Mr. Sholokhov." 

After the dinner we went off into another room, where there were different 
conversations going on. There was a Princess Somebody of Denmark sitting at a table 
with a number of people around her, and I saw an empty chair at their table and sat down. 



She turned to me and said, "Oh! You're one of the Nobel-Prize-winners. In what 
field did you do your work?" 

"In physics," I said. 

"Oh. Well, nobody knows anything about that, so I guess we can’t talk about it." 

"On the contrary," I answered. "It's because somebody knows something about it 
that we can't talk about physics. It's the things that nobody knows anything about that we 
can discuss. We can talk about the weather; we can talk about social problems; we can 
talk about psychology; we can talk about international finance — gold transfers we can't 
talk about, because those are understood — so it's the subject that nobody knows anything 
about that we can all talk about!" 

I don’t know how they do it. There's a way of forming ice on the surface of the 
face, and she did it! She turned to talk to somebody else. 

After a while I could tell I was completely cut out of the conversation, so I got up 
and started away. The Japanese ambassador, who was also sitting at that table, jumped up 
and walked after me. "Professor Feynman," he said, "there is something I should l ik e to 
tell you about diplomacy." 

He went into a long story about how a young man in Japan goes to the university 
and studies international relations because he thinks he can make a contribution to his 
country. As a sophomore he begins to have slight twinges of doubt about what he is 
learning. After college he takes his first post in an embassy and has still more doubts 
about his understanding of diplomacy, until he finally realizes that nobody knows 
anything about international relations. At that point, he can become an ambassador! "So 
Professor Feynman," he said, "next time you give examples of things that everybody 
talks about that nobody kn ows about, please include international relations!" 

He was a very interesting man, and we got to talking. I had always been interested 
in how it is the different countries and different peoples develop differently. I told the 
ambassador that there was one thing that always seemed to me to be a remarkable 
phenomenon: how Japan had developed itself so rapidly to become such a modem and 
important country in the world. "What is the aspect and character of the Japanese people 
that made it possible for the Japanese to do that?" I asked. 

The ambassador answered in a way I l ik e to hear: "I don't know," he said. "I 
might suppose something, but I don't know if it's true. The people of Japan believed they 
had only one way of moving up: to have their children educated more than they were; 
that it was very important for them to move out of their peasantry to become educated. So 
there has been a great energy in the family to encourage the children to do well in school, 
and to be pushed forward. Because of this tendency to learn things all the time, new ideas 
from the outside would spread through the educational system very easily. Perhaps that is 
one of the reasons why Japan has advanced so rapidly." 

All in all, I must say I enjoyed the visit to Sweden, in the end. Instead of coming 
home immediately, I went to CERN, the European center for nuclear research in 
Switzerland, to give a talk. I appeared before my colleagues in the suit that I had worn to 
the King's Dinner — I had never given a talk in a suit before — and I began by saying, 
"Funny thing, you know; in Sweden we were sitting around, talking about whether there 
are any changes as a result of our having won the Nobel Prize, and as a matter of fact, I 
think I already see a change: I rather l ik e this suit." 

Everybody says "Booooo!" and Weisskopf jumps up and tears off his coat and 



says, "We’re not gonna wear suits at lectures!" 

I took my coat off, loosened my tie, and said, "By the time I had been through 
Sweden, I was beginning to like this stuff, but now that I’m back in the world, 
everything's all right again. Thanks for straightening me out!" They didn’t want me to 
change. So it was very quick: at CERN they undid everything that they had done in 
Sweden. 

It's nice that I got some money — I was able to buy a beach house — but 
altogether, I think it would have been much nicer not to have had the Prize — because you 
never, any longer, can be taken straightforwardly in any public situation. 

In a way, the Nobel Prize has been something of a pain in the neck, though there 
was at least one time that I got some fun out of it. Shortly after I won the Prize, Gweneth 
and I received an invitation from the Brazilian government to be the guests of honor at 
the Camaval celebrations in Rio. We gladly accepted and had a great time. We went from 
one dance to another and reviewed the big street parade that featured the famous samba 
schools playing their wonderful rhythms and music. Photographers from newspapers and 
magazines were taking pictures all the time — "Here, the Professor from America is 
dancing with Miss Brazil." 

It was fun to be a "celebrity," but we were obviously the wrong celebrities. 
Nobody was very excited about the guests of honor that year. I found out later how our 
invitation had come about. Gina Lollobrigida was supposed to be the guest of honor, but 
just before Camaval, she said no. The Minister of Tourism, who was in charge of 
organizing Camaval, had some friends at the Center for Physical Research who knew I 
had played in a samba band, and since I had recently won the Nobel Prize, I was briefly 
in the news. In a moment of panic the Minister and his friends got this crazy idea to 
replace Gina Lollobrigida with the professor of physics! 

Needless to say, the Minister did such a bad job on that Camaval that he lost his 
position in the government. 


Bringing Culture to the Physicists 

Nina Byers, a professor at UCLA, became in charge of the physics colloquium 
sometime in the early seventies. The colloquia are normally a place where physicists 
from other universities come and talk pure technical stuff. But partly as a result of the 
atmosphere of that particular period of time, she got the idea that the physicists needed 
more culture, so she thought she would arrange something along those lines: Since Los 
Angeles is near Mexico, she would have a colloquium on the mathematics and astronomy 
of the Mayans — the old civilization of Mexico. 

(Remember my attitude to culture: This kind of thing would have driven me crazy 
if it were in my university!) 

She started looking for a professor to lecture on the subject, and couldn’t find 
anybody at UCLA who was quite an expert. She telephoned various places and still 
couldn’t find anybody. 

Then she remembered Professor Otto Neugebauer, of Brown University, the great 
expert on Babylonian mathematics.* She telephoned him in Rhode Island and asked if he 
knew someone on the West Coast who could lecture on Mayan mathematics and 



astronomy. 


*When I was a young professor at Cornell, Professor Neugebauer had come one year to 
give a sequence of lectures, called the Messenger Lectures, on Babylonian mathematics. They 
were wonderful. Oppenheimer lectured the next year. I remember thinking to myself, "Wouldn't it 
be nice to come, someday, and be able to give lectures like that!" Some years later, when I was 
refusing invitations to lecture at various places, I was invited to give the Messenger Lectures at 
Cornell. Of course I couldn't refuse, because I had put that in my mind so I accepted an invitation 
to go over to Bob Wilson's house for a weekend and we discussed various ideas. The result was 
a series of lectures called "The Character of Physical Law." 

"Yes," he said. "I do. He's not a professional anthropologist or a historian; he's an 
amateur. But he certainly knows a lot about it. His name is Richard Feynman." 

She nearly died! She's trying to bring some culture to the physicists, and the only 
way to do it is to get a physicist! 

The only reason I knew anything about Mayan mathematics was that I was getting 
exhausted on my honeymoon in Mexico with my second wife, Mary Lou. She was 
greatly interested in art history, particularly that of Mexico. So we went to Mexico for 
our honeymoon and we climbed up pyramids and down pyramids; she had me following 
her all over the place. She showed me many interesting things, such as certain 
relationships in the designs of various figures, but after a few days (and nights) of going 
up and down in hot and steamy jungles, I was exhausted. 

In some little Guatemalan town in the middle of nowhere we went into a museum 
that had a case displaying a manuscript full of strange symbols, pictures, and bars and 
dots. It was a copy (made by a man named Villacorta) of the Dresden Codex, an original 
book made by the Mayans found in a museum in Dresden. I knew the bars and dots were 
numbers. My father had taken me to the New York World's Fair when I was a little kid, 
and there they had reconstructed a Mayan temple. I remembered him telling me how the 
Mayans had invented the zero and had done many interesting things. 

The museum had copies of the codex for sale, so I bought one. On each page at 
the left was the codex copy, and on the right a description and partial translation in 
Spanish. 

I love puzzles and codes, so when I saw the bars and dots, I thought, "I'm gonna 
have some fun!" I covered up the Spanish with a piece of yellow paper and began playing 
this game of deciphering the Mayan bars and dots, sitting in the hotel room, while my 
wife climbed up and down the pyramids all day. 

I quickly figured out that a bar was equal to five dots, what the symbol for zero 
was, and so on. It took me a little longer to figure out that the bars and dots always 
carried at twenty the first time, but they carried at eighteen the second time (making 
cycles of 360). I also worked out all kinds of things about various faces: they had surely 
meant certain days and weeks. 

After we got back home I continued to work on it. Altogether, it's a lot of fun to 
try to decipher something like that, because when you start out you don't know anything - 
- you have no clue to go by. But then you notice certain numbers that appear often, and 
add up to other numbers, and so on. 

There was one place in the codex where the number 584 was very prominent. 

This 584 was divided into periods of 236, 90, 250, and 8. Another prominent number was 
2920, or 584 x 5 (also 365 x 8). There was a table of multiples of 2920 up to 13 x 2920, 



then there were multiples of 13 x 2920 for a while, and then — funny numbers! They were 
errors, as far as I could tell. Only many years later did I figure out what they were. 

Because figures denoting days were associated with this 584 which was divided 
up so peculiarly, I figured if it wasn’t some mythical period of some sort, it might be 
something astronomical. Finally I went down to the astronomy library and looked it up, 
and found that 583.92 days is the period of Venus as it appears from the earth. Then the 
236, 90, 250, 8 became apparent: it must be the phases that Venus goes through. It’s a 
morning star, then it can't be seen (it's on the far side of the sun); then it's an evening star, 
and finally it disappears again (it's between the earth and the sun). The 90 and the 8 are 
different because Venus moves more slowly through the sky when it is on the far side of 
the sun compared to when it passes between the earth and the sun. The difference 
between the 236 and the 250 might indicate a difference between the eastern and western 
horizons in Maya land. 

I discovered another table nearby that had periods of 11,959 days. This turned out 
to be a table for predicting lunar eclipses. Still another table had multiples of 91 in 
descending order. I never did figure that one out (nor has anyone else). 

When I had worked out as much as I could, I finally decided to look at the 
Spanish commentary to see how much I was able to figure out. It was complete nonsense. 
This symbol was Saturn, this symbol was a god — it didn’t make the slightest bit of sense. 
So I didn't have to have covered the commentary; I wouldn’t have learned anything from 
it anyway. 

After that I began to read a lot about the Mayans, and found that the great man in 
this business was Eric Thompson, some of whose books I now have. 

When Nina Byers called me up I realized that I had lost my copy of the Dresden 
Codex. (I had lent it to Mrs. H. E. Robertson, who had found a Mayan codex in an old 
trunk of an antique dealer in Paris. She had brought it back to Pasadena for me to look at 
— I still remember driving home with it on the front seat of my car, thinking, "I've gotta 
be careful driving: I've got the new codex" — but as soon as I looked at it carefully, I 
could see immediately that it was a complete fake. After a little bit of work I could find 
where each picture in the new codex had come from in the Dresden Codex. So I lent her 
my book to show her, and I eventually forgot she had it.) So the librarians at UCLA 
worked very hard to find another copy of Villacorta's rendition of the Dresden Codex, 
and lent it to me. 

I did all the calculations all over again, and in fact I got a little bit further than I 
did before: I figured out that those "funny numbers" which I thought before were errors 
were really integer multiples of something closer to the correct period (583.923) — the 
Mayans had realized that 584 wasn’t exactly right!* 

*While I was studying this table of corrections for the period of Venus, I discovered a rare 
exaggeration by Mr. Thompson. He wrote that by looking at the table, you can deduce how the 
Mayans calculated the correct period of Venus -- use this number four times and that difference 
once and you get an accuracy of one day in 4000 years, which is really quite remarkable, 
especially since the Mayans observed for only a few hundred years. 

Thompson happened to pick a combination which fit what he thought was the right period 
for Venus, 583.92. But when you put in a more exact figure, something like 583.923, you find the 
Mayans were off by more. Of course, by choosing a different combination you can get the 
numbers in the table to give you 583.923 with the same remarkable accuracy! 



After the colloquium at UCLA Professor Byers presented me with some beautiful 
color reproductions of the Dresden Codex. A few months later Caltech wanted me to give 
the same lecture to the public in Pasadena. Robert Rowan, a real estate man, lent me 
some very valuable stone carvings of Mayan gods and ceramic figures for the Caltech 
lecture. It was probably highly illegal to take something like that out of Mexico, and they 
were so valuable that we hired security guards to protect them. 

A few days before the Caltech lecture there was a big splurge in the New York 
Times, which reported that a new codex had been discovered. There were only three 
codices (two of which are hard to get anything out of) known to exist at the time — 
hundreds of thousands had been burned by Spanish priests as "works of the Devil." My 
cousin was working for the AP, so she got me a glossy picture copy of what the New 
York Times had published and I made a slide of it to include in my talk. 

This new codex was a fake. In my lecture I pointed out that the numbers were in 
the style of the Madrid codex, but were 236, 90, 250, 8 — rather a coincidence! Out of the 
hundred thousand books originally made we get another fragment, and it has the same 
thing on it as the other fragments! It was obviously, again, one of these put-together 
things which had nothing original in it. 

These people who copy things never have the courage to make up something 
really different. If you find something that is really new, it's got to have something 
different. A real hoax would be to take something like the period of Mars, invent a 
mythology to go with it, and then draw pictures associated with this mythology with 
numbers appropriate to Mars — not in an obvious fashion; rather, have tables of multiples 
of the period with some mysterious "errors," and so on. The numbers should have to be 
worked out a little bit. Then people would say, "Geez! This has to do with Mars!" In 
addition, there should be a number of things in it that are not understandable, and are not 
exactly like what has been seen before. That would make a good fake. 

I got a big kick out of giving my talk on "Deciphering Mayan Hieroglyphics." 
There I was, being something I'm not, again. People filed into the auditorium past these 
glass cases, admiring the color reproductions of the Dresden Codex and the authentic 
Mayan artifacts watched over by an armed guard in uniform; they heard a two-hour 
lecture on Mayan mathematics and astronomy from an amateur expert in the field (who 
even told them how to spot a fake codex), and then they went out, admiring the cases 
again. Murray Gell-Mann countered in the following weeks by giving a beautiful set of 
six lectures concerning the linguistic relations of all the languages of the world. 


Found Out in Paris 

I gave a series of lectures in physics that the Addison-Wesley Company made into 
a book, and one time at lunch we were discussing what the cover of the book should look 
like. I thought that since the lectures were a combination of the real world and 
mathematics, it would be a good idea to have a picture of a drum, and on top of it some 
mathematical diagrams — circles and lines for the nodes of the oscillating drumheads, 
which were discussed in the book. 

The book came out with a plain, red cover, but for some reason, in the preface, 
there's a picture of me playing a drum. I think they put it in there to satisfy this idea they 



got that "the author wants a drum somewhere." Anyway, everybody wonders why that 
picture of me playing drums is in the preface of the Feynman Lectures, because it doesn't 
have any diagrams on it, or any other things which would make it clear. (It's true that I 
like drumming, but that's another story.) 

At Los Alamos things were pretty tense from all the work, and there wasn’t any 
way to amuse yourself: there weren’t any movies, or anything like that. But I discovered 
some drums that the boys' school, which had been there previously, had collected: Los 
Alamos was in the middle of New Mexico, where there are lots of Indian villages. So I 
amused myself — sometimes alone, sometimes with another guy — just making noise, 
playing on these drums. I didn’t know any particular rhythm, but the rhythms of the 
Indians were rather simple, the drums were good, and I had fun. 

Sometimes I would take the drums with me into the woods at some distance, so I 
wouldn't disturb anybody, and would beat them with a stick, and sing. I remember one 
night walking around a tree, looking at the moon, and beating the drum, making believe I 
was an Indian. 

One day a guy came up to me and said, "Around Thanksgiving you weren’t out in 
the woods beating a drum, were you?" 

"Yes, I was," I said. 

"Oh! Then my wife was right!" Then he told me this story: 

One night he heard some drum music in the distance, and went upstairs to the 
other guy in the duplex house that they live in, and the other guy heard it too. Remember, 
all these guys were from the East. They didn’t know anything about Indians, and they 
were very interested: the Indians must have been having some kind of ceremony, or 
something exciting, and the two men decided to go out to see what it was. 

As they walked along, the music got louder as they came nearer, and they began 
to get nervous. They realized that the Indians probably had scouts out watching so that 
nobody would disturb their ceremony. So they got down on their bellies and crawled 
along the trail until the sound was just over the next hill, apparently. They crawled up 
over the hill and discovered to their surprise that it was only one Indian, doing the 
ceremony all by himself — dancing around a tree, beating the drum with a stick, chanting. 
The two guys backed away from him slowly, because they didn’t want to disturb him: He 
was probably setting up some kind of spell, or something. 

They told their wives what they saw, and the wives said, "Oh, it must have been 
Feynman — he l ik es to beat drums." 

"Don’t be ridiculous!" the men said. "Even Feynman wouldn’t be that crazy!" 

So the next week they set about trying to figure out who the Indian was. There 
were Indians from the nearby reservation working at Los Alamos, so they asked one 
Indian, who was a technician in the technical area, who it could be. The Indian asked 
around, but none of the other Indians knew who it might be, except there was one Indian 
whom nobody could talk to. He was an Indian who knew his race: He had two big braids 
down his back and held his head high; whenever he walked anywhere he walked with 
dignity, alone; and nobody could talk to him. You would be afraid to go up to him and 
ask him anything; he had too much dignity. He was a furnace man. So nobody ever had 
the nerve to ask this Indian, and they decided it must have been him. (I was pleased to 
find that they had discovered such a typical Indian, such a wonderful Indian, that I might 
have been. It was quite an honor to be mistaken for this man.) 



So the fella who’d been talking to me was just checking at the last minute — 
husbands always like to prove their wives wrong — and he found out, as husbands often 
do, that his wife was quite right. 

I got pretty good at playing the drums, and would play them when we had parties. 
I didn't know what I was doing; I just made rhythms — and I got a reputation: Everybody 
at Los Alamos knew I liked to play drums. 

When the war was over, and we were going back to "civilization," the people 
there at Los Alamos teased me that I wouldn’t be able to play drums any more because 
they made too much noise. And since I was trying to become a dignified professor in 
Ithaca, I sold the drum that I had bought sometime during my stay at Los Alamos. 

The following summer I went back out to New Mexico to work on some report, 
and when I saw the drums again, I couldn’t stand it. I bought myself another drum, and 
thought, "I'll just bring it back with me this time so I can look at it." 

That year at Cornell I had a small apartment inside a bigger house. I had the drum 
in there, just to look at, but one day I couldn't quite resist: I said, "Well, I’ll just be very 
quiet. . ." 

I sat on a chair and put the drum between my legs and played it with my fingers a 
little bit: hup, bup, bup, huddle hup. Then a little bit louder — after all, it was tempting 
me! I got a little bit louder and BOOM! — the telephone rang. 

"Hello?" 

"This is your landlady. Are you beating drums down there?" 

"Yes; I'm sor —" 

"It sounds so good. I wonder if I could come down and listen to it more directly?" 

So from that time on the landlady would always come down when I’d start to 
drum. That was freedom, all right. I had a very good time from then on, beating the 
drums. 

Around that time I met a lady from the Belgian Congo who gave me some 
ethnological records. In those days, records l ik e that were rare, with drum music from the 
Watusi and other tribes of Africa. I really admired the Watusi drummers very, very much, 
and I used to try to imitate them — not very accurately, but just to sound something like 
them — and I developed a larger number of rhythms as a result of that. 

One time I was in the recreation hall, late at night, when there weren't many 
people, and I picked up a wastebasket and started to beat the back end of it. Some guy 
from way downstairs came running all the way up and said, "Hey! You play drums!" It 
turned out he really knew how to play drums, and he taught me how to play bongos. 

There was some guy in the music department who had a collection of African 
music, and I’d come to his house and play drums. He’d make recordings of me, and then 
at his parties, he had a game that he called "Africa or Ithaca?" in which he’d play some 
recordings of drum music, and the idea was to guess whether what you were hearing was 
manufactured in the continent of Africa, or locally. So I must have been fairly good at 
imitating African music by that time. 

When I came to Caltech, I used to go down to the Sunset Strip a lot. One time 
there was a group of drummers led by a big fella from Nigeria called Ukonu, playing this 
wonderful drum music — just percussion — at one of the nightclubs. The second-in- 
command, who was especially nice to me, invited me to come up on the stage with them 
and play a little. So I got up there with the other guys and played along with them on the 



drums for a little while. 

I asked the second guy if Ukonu ever gave lessons, and he said yes. So I used to 
go down to Ukonu's place, near Century Boulevard (where the Watts riots later occurred) 
to get lessons in drumming. The lessons weren’t very efficient: he would stall around, talk 
to other people, and be interrupted by all kinds of things. But when they worked they 
were very exciting, and I learned a lot from him. 

At dances near Ukonu's place, there would be only a few whites, but it was much 
more relaxed than it is today. One time they had a drumming contest, and I didn’t do very 
well: They said my drumming was "too intellectual"; theirs was much more pulsing. 

One day when I was at Caltech I got a very serious telephone call. 

"This is Mr. Trowbridge, Mahster of the Polytechnic School." The Polytechnic 
School was a small, private school which was across the street diagonally from Caltech. 
Mr. Trowbridge continued in a very formal voice: "I have a friend of yours here, who 
would like to speak to you." 

"OK." 

"Hello, Dick!" It was Ukonu! It turned out the Master of the Polytechnic School 
was not as formal as he was making himself out to be, and had a great sense of humor. 
Ukonu was visiting the school to play for the kids, so he invited me to come over and be 
on the stage with him, and play along. So we played for the kids together: I played 
bongos (which I had in my office) against his big tumba drum. 

Ukonu had a regular thing: He went to various schools and talked about the 
African drums and what they meant, and told about the music. He had a terrific 
personality and a grand smile; he was a very, very nice man. He was just sensational on 
the drums — he had records out — and was here studying medicine. He went back to 
Nigeria at the beginning of the war there — or before the war — and I don’t know what 
happened to him. 

After Ukonu left I didn’t do very much drumming, except at parties once in a 
while, entertaining a little bit. One time I was at a dinner party at the Leightons' house, 
and Bob's son Ralph and a friend asked me if I wanted to drum. Thinking that they were 
asking me to do a solo, I said no. But then they started drumming on some little wooden 
tables, and I couldn’t resist: I grabbed a table too, and the three of us played on these little 
wooden tables, which made lots of interesting sounds. 

Ralph and his friend Tom Rutishauser liked playing drums, and we began meeting 
every week to just ad lib, develop rhythms and work stuff out. These two guys were real 
musicians: Ralph played piano, and Tom played the cello. All I had done was rhythms, 
and I didn’t know anything about music, which, as far as I could tell, was just drumming 
with notes. But we worked out a lot of good rhythms and played a few times at some of 
the schools to entertain the kids. We also played rhythms for a dance class at a local 
college — something I learned was fun to do when I was working at Brookhaven for a 
while — and called ourselves The Three Quarks, so you can figure out when that was. 

One time I went to Vancouver to talk to the students there, and they had a party 
with a real hot rock-type band playing down in the basement. The band was very nice: 
they had an extra cowbell lying around, and they encouraged me to play it. So I started to 
play a little bit, and since their music was very rhythmic (and the cowbell is just an 
accompaniment — you can't screw it up) I really got hot. 

After the party was over, the guy who organized the party told me that the 



bandleader said, "Geez! Who was that guy who came down and played on the cowbell! 

He can really knock out a rhythm on that thing! And by the way, that big shot this party 
was supposed to be for — you know, he never came down here; I never did see who it 
was!" 

Anyhow, at Caltech there's a group that puts on plays. Some of the actors are 
Caltech students; others are from the outside. When there's a small part, such as a 
policeman who’s supposed to arrest somebody, they get one of the professors to do it. It's 
always a big joke — the professor comes on and arrests somebody, and goes off again. 

A few years ago the group was doing Guys and Dolls, and there was a scene 
where the main guy takes the girl to Havana, and they're in a nightclub. The director 
thought it would be a good idea to have the bongo player on the stage in the nightclub be 
me. 

I went to the first rehearsal, and the lady directing the show pointed to the 
orchestra conductor and said, "Jack will show you the music." 

Well, that petrified me. I don’t kn ow how to read music; I thought all I had to do 
was get up there on the stage and make some noise. 

Jack was sitting by the piano, and he pointed to the music and said, "OK, you start 
here, you see, and you do this. Then I play plonk, plonk, plonk” — he played a few notes 
on the piano. He turned the page. "Then you play this, and now we both pause for a 
speech, you see, here" — and he turned some more pages and said, "Finally, you play 
this." 

He showed me this "music" that was written in some kind of crazy pattern of little 
x's in the bars and lines. He kept telling me all this stuff, thinking I was a musician, and it 
was completely impossible for me to remember any of it. 

Fortunately, I got ill the next day, and couldn’t come to the next rehearsal. I asked 
my friend Ralph to go for me, and since he's a musician, he should know what it's all 
about. Ralph came back and said, "It's not so bad. First, at the very beginning, you have 
to do something exactly right because you're starting the rhythm out for the rest of the 
orchestra, which will mesh in with it. But after the orchestra comes in, it's a matter of ad- 
libbing, and there will be times when we have to pause for speeches, but I think we’ll be 
able to figure that out from the cues the orchestra conductor gives." 

In the meantime I had gotten the director to accept Ralph too, so the two of us 
would be on the stage. He’d play the tumba and I’d play the bongos — so that made it a 
helluva lot easier for me. 

So Ralph showed me what the rhythm was. It must have been only about twenty 
or thirty beats, but it had to be just so. I’d never had to play anything just so, and it was 
very hard for me to get it right. Ralph would patiently explain, "left hand, and right hand, 
and two left hands, then right. . ." I worked very hard, and finally, very slowly, I began to 
get the rhythm just right. It took me a helluva long time — many days — to get it. 

A week later we went to the rehearsal and found there was a new drummer there - 
- the regular drummer had quit the band to do something else — and we introduced 
ourselves to him: 

"Hi. We’re the guys who are going to be on stage for the Havana scene." 

"Oh, hi. Let me find the scene here. . ." and he turned to the page where our scene 
was, took out his drumming stick, and said, "Oh, you start off the scene with. . ." and 
with his stick against the side of his drum he goes bing, bong, bang-a-bang, bing-a-bing, 



bang, bang at full speed, while he was looking at the music! What a shock that was to 
me. I had worked for four days to try to get that damn rhythm, and he could just patter it 
right out! 

Anyway, after practicing again and again I finally got it straight and played it in 
the show, ft was pretty successful: Everybody was amused to see the professor on stage 
playing the bongos, and the music wasn't so bad; but that part at the beginning, that had 
to be the same: that was hard. 

In the Havana nightclub scene some of the students had to do some sort of dance 
that had to be choreographed. So the director had gotten the wife of one of the guys at 
Caltech, who was a choreographer working at that time for Universal Studios, to teach 
the boys how to dance. She liked our drumming, and when the shows were over, she 
asked us if we would like to drum in San Francisco for a ballet. 

"WHAT?" 

Yes. She was moving to San Francisco, and was choreographing a ballet for a 
small ballet school there. She had the idea of creating a ballet in which the music was 
nothing but percussion. She wanted Ralph and me to come over to her house before she 
moved and play the different rhythms that we knew, and from those she would make up a 
story that went with the rhythms. 

Ralph had some misgivings, but I encouraged him to go along with this 
adventure. I did insist, however, that she not tell anybody there that I was a professor of 
physics, Nobel-Prize-winner, or any other baloney. I didn’t want to do the drumming if I 
was doing it because, as Samuel Johnson said, If you see a dog walking on his hind legs, 
it's not so much that he does it well, as that he does it at all. I didn’t want to do it if I was a 
physics professor doing it at all; we were just some musicians she had found in Fos 
Angeles, who were going to come up and play this drum music that they had composed. 

So we went over to her house and played various rhythms we had worked out. 

She took some notes, and soon after, that same night, she got this story cooked up in her 
mind and said, "OK, I want fifty-two repetitions of this; forty bars of that; whatever of 
this, that, this, that. . ." 

We went home, and the next night we made a tape at Ralph's house. We played 
all the rhythms for a few minutes, and then Ralph made some cuts and splices with his 
tape recorder to get the various lengths right. She took a copy of our tape with her when 
she moved, and began training the dancers with it in San Francisco. 

Meanwhile we had to practice what was on that tape: fifty-two cycles of this, 
forty cycles of that, and so on. What we had done spontaneously (and spliced) earlier, we 
now had to learn exactly. We had to imitate our own damn tape! 

The big problem was counting. I thought Ralph would know how to do that 
because he's a musician, but we both discovered something funny. The "playing 
department" in our minds was also the "talking department" for counting — we couldn't 
play and count at the same time! 

When we got to our first rehearsal in San Francisco, we discovered that by 
watching the dancers we didn’t have to count because the dancers went through certain 
motions. 

There were a number of things that happened to us because we were supposed to 
be professional musicians and I wasn't. For example, one of the scenes was about a 
beggar woman who sifts through the sand on a Caribbean beach where the society ladies, 



who had come out at the beginning of the ballet, had been. The music that the 
choreographer had used to create this scene was made on a special drum that Ralph and 
his father had made rather amateurishly some years before, and out of which we had 
never had much luck in getting a good tone. But we discovered that if we sat opposite 
each other on chairs and put this "crazy drum" between us on our knees, with one guy 
beating bidda-bidda-bidda-bidda-bidda rapidly with his two fingers, constantly, the other 
fella could push on the drum in different places with his two hands and change the pitch. 
Now it would go booda-booda-booda-bidda-beeda-beeda-beeda-bidda-booda-booda- 
booda-badda-bidda-bidda-bidda-badda, creating a lot of interesting sounds. 

Well, the dancer who played the beggar woman wanted the rises and falls to 
coincide with her dance (our tape had been made arbitrarily for this scene), so she 
proceeded to explain to us what she was going to do: "First, I do four of these movements 
this way; then I bend down and sift through the sand this way for eight counts; then I 
stand and turn this way." I knew damn well I couldn't keep track of this, so I interrupted 
her: 

"Just go ahead and do the dance, and I’ll play along." 

"But don’t you want to know how the dance goes? You see, after I've finished the 
second sifting part, I go for eight counts over this way." It was no use; I couldn’t 
remember anything, and I wanted to interrupt her again, but then there was this problem: 

I would look l ik e I was not a real musician! 

Well, Ralph covered for me very smoothly by explaining, "Mr. Feynman has a 
special technique for this type of situation: He prefers to develop the dynamics directly 
and intuitively, as he sees you dance. Let's try it once that way, and if you're not satisfied, 
we can correct it." 

Well, she was a first-rate dancer, and you could anticipate what she was going to 
do. If she was going to dig into the sand, she would get ready to go down into the sand; 
every motion was smooth and expected, so it was rather easy to make the bzzzzs and 
bshshs and boodas and biddas with my hands quite appropriate to what she was doing, 
and she was very satisfied with it. So we got past that moment where we might have had 
our cover blown. 

The ballet was kind of a success. Although there weren’t many people in the 
audience, the people who came to see the performances liked it very much. 

Before we went to San Francisco for the rehearsals and the performances, we 
weren't sure of the whole idea. I mean, we thought the choreographer was insane: first, 
the ballet has only percussion; second, that we’re good enough to make music for a ballet 
and get paid for it was surely crazy! For me, who had never had any "culture," to end up 
as a professional musician for a ballet was the height of achievement, as it were. 

We didn’t think that she’d be able to find ballet dancers who would be willing to 
dance to our drum music. (As a matter of fact, there was one prima donna from Brazil, 
the wife of the Portuguese consul, who decided it was beneath her to dance to it.) But the 
other dancers seemed to like it very much, and my heart felt good when we played for 
them for the first time in rehearsal. The delight they felt when they heard how our 
rhythms really sounded (they had until then been using our tape played on a small 
cassette recorder) was genuine, and I had much more confidence when I saw how they 
reacted to our actual playing. And from the comments of the people who had come to the 
performances, we realized that we were a success. 



The choreographer wanted to do another ballet to our drumming the following 
spring, so we went through the same procedure. We made a tape of some more rhythms, 
and she made up another story, this time set in Africa. I talked to Professor Munger at 
Caltech and got some real African phrases to sing at the beginning (GAwa baNYUma 
GAwa WO, or something like that), and I practiced them until I had them just so. 

Later, we went up to San Francisco for a few rehearsals. When we first got there, 
we found they had a problem. They couldn’t figure out how to make elephant tusks that 
looked good on stage. The ones they had made out of papier mache were so bad that 
some of the dancers were embarrassed to dance in front of them. 

We didn’t offer any solution, but rather waited to see what would happen when 
the performances came the following weekend. Meanwhile, I arranged to visit Werner 
Erhard, whom I had known from participating in some conferences he had organized. I 
was sitting in his beautiful home, listening to some philosophy or idea he was trying to 
explain to me, when all of a sudden I was hypnotized. 

"What's the matter?" he said. 

My eyes popped out as I exclaimed, "Tusks!” Behind him, on the floor, were these 
enormous, massive, beautiful ivory tusks! 

He lent us the tusks. They looked very good on stage (to the great relief of the 
dancers): real elephant tusks, super size, courtesy of Werner Erhard. 

The choreographer moved to the East Coast, and put on her Caribbean ballet 
there. We heard later that she entered that ballet in a contest for choreographers from all 
over the United States, and she finished first or second. Encouraged by this success, she 
entered another competition, this time in Paris, for choreographers from all over the 
world. She brought a high-quality tape we had made in San Francisco and trained some 
dancers there in France to do a small section of the ballet — that's how she entered the 
contest. 

She did very well. She got into the final round, where there were only two left — a 
Latvian group that was doing a standard ballet with their regular dancers to beautiful 
classical music, and a maverick from America, with only the two dancers that she had 
trained in France, dancing to a ballet which had nothing but our drum music. 

She was the favorite of the audience, but it wasn’t a popularity contest, and the 
judges decided that the Latvians had won. She went to the judges afterwards to find out 
the weakness in her ballet. 

"Well, Madame, the music was not really satisfactory. It was not subtle enough. 
Controlled crescendoes were missing. . ." 

And so we were at last found out: When we came to some really cultured people 
in Paris, who knew music from drums, we flunked out. 


Altered States 

I used to give a lecture every Wednesday over at the Hughes Aircraft Company, 
and one day I got there a little ahead of time, and was flirting around with the 
receptionist, as usual, when about half a dozen people came in — a man, a woman, and a 
few others. I had never seen them before. The man said, "Is this where Professor 
Feynman is giving some lectures?" 



"This is the place," the receptionist replied. 

The man asks if his group can come to the lectures. 

"I don’t think you'd like ’em much," I say. "They're kind of technical." 

Pretty soon the woman, who was rather clever, figured it out: "I bet you're 
Professor Feynman!" 

It turned out the man was John Lilly, who had earlier done some work with 
dolphins. He and his wife were doing some research into sense deprivation, and had built 
some tanks. 

"Isn’t it true that you're supposed to get hallucinations under those 
circumstances?" I asked, excitedly. 

"That is true indeed." 

I had always had this fascination with the images from dreams and other images 
that come to the mind that haven’t got a direct sensory source, and how it works in the 
head, and I wanted to see hallucinations. I had once thought to take drugs, but I got kind 
of scared of that: I love to think, and I don’t want to screw up the machine. But it seemed 
to me that just lying around in a sense-deprivation tank had no physiological danger, so I 
was very anxious to try it. 

I quickly accepted the Lillys' invitation to use the tanks, a very kind invitation on 
their part, and they came to listen to the lecture with their group. 

So the following week I went to try the tanks. Mr. Lilly introduced me to the 
tanks as he must have done with other people. There were lots of bulbs, like neon lights, 
with different gases in them. He showed me the Periodic Table and made up a lot of 
mystic hokey-poke about different kinds of lights that have different kinds of influences. 
He told me how you get ready to go into the tank by looking at yourself in the mirror 
with your nose up against it — all kinds of wicky-wack things, all kinds of gorp. I didn’t 
pay any attention to the gorp, but I did everything because I wanted to get into the tanks, 
and I also thought that perhaps such preparations might make it easier to have 
hallucinations. So I went through everything according to the way he said. The only thing 
that proved difficult was choosing what color light I wanted, especially as the tank was 
supposed to be dark inside. 

A sense-deprivation tank is like a big bathtub, but with a cover that comes down. 
It's completely dark inside, and because the cover is thick, there's no sound. There's a 
little pump that pumps air in, but it turns out you don’t need to worry about air because 
the volume of air is rather large, and you're only in there for two or three hours, and you 
don’t really consume a lot of air when you breathe normally. Mr. Lilly said that the 
pumps were there to put people at ease, so I figured it's just psychological, and asked him 
to turn the pump off, because it made a little bit of noise. 

The water in the tank has Epsom salts in it to make it denser than normal water, so 
you float in it rather easily. The temperature is kept at body temperature, or 94, or 
something — he had it all figured out. There wasn’t supposed to be any light, any sound, 
any temperature sensation, no nothing! Once in a while you might drift over to the side 
and bump slightly, or because of condensation on the ceiling of the tank a drop of water 
might fall, but these slight disturbances were very rare. 

I must have gone about a dozen times, each time spending about two and a half 
hours in the tank. The first time I didn’t get any hallucinations, but after I had been in the 
tank, the Lillys introduced me to a man billed as a medical doctor, who told me about a 



drug called ketamine, which was used as an anesthetic. I've always been interested in 
questions related to what happens when you go to sleep, or what happens when you get 
conked out, so they showed me the papers that came with the medicine and gave me one 
tenth of the normal dose. 

I got this strange kind of feeling which I've never been able to figure out 
whenever I tried to characterize what the effect was. For instance, the drug had quite an 
effect on my vision; I felt I couldn’t see clearly. But when I’d look hard at something, it 
would be OK. It was sort of as if you didn’t care to look at things; you're sloppily doing 
this and that, feeling kind of woozy, but as soon as you look, and concentrate, everything 
is, for a moment at least, all right. I took a book they had on organic chemistry and 
looked at a table full of complicated substances, and to my surprise was able to read 
them. 

I did all kinds of other things, l ik e moving my hands toward each other from a 
distance to see if my fingers would touch each other, and although I had a feeling of 
complete disorientation, a feeling of an inability to do practically anything, I never found 
a specific thing that I couldn’t do. 

As I said before, the first time in the tank I didn’t get any hallucinations, and the 
second time I didn’t get any hallucinations. But the Lillys were very interesting people; I 
enjoyed them very, very much. They often gave me lunch, and so on, and after a while 
we discussed things on a different level than the early stuff with the lights. I realized that 
other people had found the sense-deprivation tank somewhat frightening, but to me it was 
a pretty interesting invention. I wasn’t afraid because I knew what it was: it was just a 
tank of Epsom salts. 

The third time there was a man visiting — I met many interesting people there — 
who went by the name Baba Ram Das. He was a fella from Harvard who had gone to 
India and had written a popular book called Be Here Now. He related how his guru in 
India told him how to have an "out-of-body experience" (words I had often seen written 
on the bulletin board): Concentrate on your breath, on how it goes in and out of your nose 
as you breathe. 

I figured I’d try anything to get a hallucination, and went into the tank. At some 
stage of the game I suddenly realized that — it's hard to explain — I'm an inch to one side. 
In other words, where my breath is going, in and out, in and out, is not centered: My ego 
is off to one side a little bit, by about an inch. 

I thought: "Now where is the ego located? I know everybody thinks the seat of 
thinking is in the brain, but how do they know that?" I knew already from reading things 
that it wasn’t so obvious to people before a lot of psychological studies were made. The 
Greeks thought the seat of thinking was in the liver, for instance. I wondered, "Is it 
possible that where the ego is located is learned by children looking at people putting 
their hand to their head when they say, 'Let me think’? Therefore the idea that the ego is 
located up there, behind the eyes, might be conventional!" I figured that if I could move 
my ego an inch to one side, I could move it further. This was the beginning of my 
hallucinations. 

I tried and after a while I got my ego to go down through my neck into the middle 
of my chest. When a drop of water came down and hit me on the shoulder, I felt it "up 
there," above where "I" was. Every time a drop came I was startled a little bit, and my 
ego would jump back up through the neck to the usual place. Then I would have to work 



my way down again. At first it took a lot of work to go down each time, but gradually it 
got easier. I was able to get myself all the way down to the loins, to one side, but that was 
about as far as I could go for quite a while. 

It was another time I was in the tank when I decided that if I could move myself 
to my loins, I should be able to get completely outside of my body. So I was able to "sit 
to one side." It's hard to explain — I’d move my hands and shake the water, and although I 
couldn’t see them, I knew where they were. But unlike in real life, where the hands are to 
each side, part way down, they were both to one side! The feeling in my fingers and 
everything else was exactly the same as normal, only my ego was sitting outside, 
"observing" all this. 

From then on I had hallucinations almost every time, and was able to move 
further and further outside of my body. It developed that when I would move my hands I 
would see them as sort of mechanical things that were going up and down — they weren’t 
flesh; they were mechanical. But I was still able to feel everything. The feelings would be 
exactly consistent with the motion, but I also had this feeling of "he is that." "I" even got 
out of the room, ultimately, and wandered about, going some distance to locations where 
things happened that I had seen earlier another day. 

I had many types of out-of-the-body experiences. One time, for example, I could 
"see" the back of my head, with my hands resting against it. When I moved my fingers, I 
saw them move, but between the fingers and the thumb I saw the blue sky. Of course that 
wasn’t right; it was a hallucination. But the point is that as I moved my fingers, their 
movement was exactly consistent with the motion that I was imagining that I was seeing. 
The entire imagery would appear, and be consistent with what you feel and are doing, 
much like when you slowly wake up in the morning and are touching something (and you 
don't know what it is), and suddenly it becomes clear what it is. So the entire imagery 
would suddenly appear, except it's unusual, in the sense that you usually would imagine 
the ego to be located in front of the back of the head, but instead you have it behind the 
back of the head. 

One of the things that perpetually bothered me, psychologically, while I was 
having a hallucination, was that I might have fallen asleep and would therefore be only 
dreaming. I had already had some experience with dreams, and I wanted a new 
experience. It was kind of dopey, because when you're having hallucinations, and things 
like that, you're not very sharp, so you do these dumb things that you set your mind to do, 
such as checking that you're not dreaming. So I perpetually was checking that I wasn't 
dreaming by — since my hands were often behind my head — rubbing my thumbs 
together, back and forth, feeling them. Of course I could have been dreaming that, but I 
wasn’t: I knew it was real. 

After the very beginning, when the excitement of having a hallucination made 
them "jump out," or stop happening, I was able to relax and have long hallucinations. 

A week or two after, I was thinking a great deal about how the brain works 
compared to how a computing machine works — especially how information is stored. 
One of the interesting problems in this area is how memories are stored in the brain: You 
can get at them from so many directions compared to a machine — you don’t have to 
come directly with the correct address to the memory. If I want to get at the word "rent," 
for example, I can be filling in a crossword puzzle, looking for a four-letter word that 
begins with r and ends in t; I can be thinking of types of income, or activities such as 



borrowing and lending; this in turn can lead to all sorts of other related memories or 
information. I was thinking about how to make an "imitating machine," which would 
learn language as a child does: you would talk to the machine. But I couldn’t figure out 
how to store the stuff in an organized way so the machine could get it out for its own 
purposes. 

When I went into the tank that week, and had my hallucination, I tried to think of 
very early memories. I kept saying to myself, "It's gotta be earlier; it's gotta be earlier" — 

I was never satisfied that the memories were early enough. When I got a very early 
memory — let's say from my home town of Far Rockaway — then immediately would 
come a whole sequence of memories, all from the town of Far Rockaway. If I then would 
think of something from another city — Cedarhurst, or something — then a whole lot of 
stuff that was associated with Cedarhurst would come. And so I realized that things are 
stored according to the location where you had the experience. 

I felt pretty good about this discovery, and came out of the tank, had a shower, got 
dressed, and so forth, and started driving to Hughes Aircraft to give my weekly lecture. It 
was therefore about forty-five minutes after I came out of the tank that I suddenly 
realized for the first time that I hadn’t the slightest idea of how memories are stored in the 
brain; all I had was a hallucination as to how memories are stored in the brain! What I 
had "discovered" had nothing to do with the way memories are stored in the brain; it had 
to do with the way I was playing games with myself. 

In our numerous discussions about hallucinations on my earlier visits, I had been 
trying to explain to Lilly and others that the imagination that things are real does not 
represent true reality. If you see golden globes, or something, several times, and they talk 
to you during your hallucination and tell you they are another intelligence, it doesn't 
mean they're another intelligence; it just means that you have had this particular 
hallucination. So here I had this tremendous feeling of discovering how memories are 
stored, and it's surprising that it took forty-five minutes before I realized the error that I 
had been trying to explain to everyone else. 

One of the questions I thought about was whether hallucinations, like dreams, are 
influenced by what you already have in your mind — from other experiences during the 
day or before, or from things you are expecting to see. The reason, I believe, that I had an 
out-of-body experience was that we were discussing out-of-body experiences just before 
I went into the tank. And the reason I had a hallucination about how memories are stored 
in the brain was, I think, that I had been thinking about that problem all week. 

I had considerable discussion with the various people there about the reality of 
experiences. They argued that something is considered real, in experimental science, if 
the experience can be reproduced. Thus when many people see golden globes that talk to 
them, time after time, the globes must be real. My claim was that in such situations there 
was a bit of discussion previous to going into the tank about the golden globes, so when 
the person hallucinating, with his mind already thinking about golden globes when he 
went into the tank, sees some approximation of the globes — maybe they're blue, or 
something — he thinks he's reproducing the experience. I felt that I could understand the 
difference between the type of agreement among people whose minds are set to agree, 
and the kind of agreement that you get in experimental work. It's rather amusing that it's 
so easy to tell the difference — but so hard to define it! 

I believe there's nothing in hallucinations that has anything to do with anything 



external to the internal psychological state of the person who's got the hallucination. But 
there are nevertheless a lot of experiences by a lot of people who believe there's reality in 
hallucinations. The same general idea may account for a certain amount of success that 
interpreters of dreams have. For example, some psychoanalysts interpret dreams by 
talking about the meanings of various symbols. And then, it's not completely impossible 
that these symbols do appear in dreams that follow. So I think that, perhaps, the 
interpretation of hallucinations and dreams is a self-propagating process: you'll have a 
general, more or less, success at it, especially if you discuss it carefully ahead of time. 

Ordinarily it would take me about fifteen minutes to get a hallucination going, but 
on a few occasions, when I smoked some marijuana beforehand, it came very quickly. 
But fifteen minutes was fast enough for me. 

One thing that often happened was that as the hallucination was coming on, what 
you might describe as "garbage" would come: there were simply chaotic images — 
complete, random junk. I tried to remember some of the items of the junk in order to be 
able to characterize it again, but it was particularly difficult to remember. I think I was 
getting close to the kind of thing that happens when you begin to fall asleep: There are 
apparent logical connections, but when you try to remember what made you think of 
what you’re thinking about, you can't remember. As a matter of fact, you soon forget 
what it is that you're trying to remember. I can only remember things like a white sign 
with a pimple on it, in Chicago, and then it disappears. That kind of stuff all the time. 

Mr. Lilly had a number of different tanks, and we tried a number of different 
experiments. It didn’t seem to make much difference as far as hallucinations were 
concerned, and I became convinced that the tank was unnecessary. Now that I saw what 
to do, I realized that all you have to do is sit quietly — why was it necessary that you had 
to have everything absolutely super duper? 

So when I’d come home I'd turn out the lights and sit in the living room in a 
comfortable chair, and try and try — it never worked. I've never been able to have a 
hallucination outside of the tanks. Of course I would like to have done it at home, and I 
don’t doubt that you could meditate and do it if you practice, but I didn’t practice. 


Cargo Cult Science* 

*Adapted from the Caltech commencement address given in 1974. 

During the Middle Ages there were all kinds of crazy ideas, such as that a piece of 
rhinoceros horn would increase potency. Then a method was discovered for separating 
the ideas — which was to try one to see if it worked, and if it didn’t work, to eliminate it. 
This method became organized, of course, into science. And it developed very well, so 
that we are now in the scientific age. It is such a scientific age, in fact, that we have 
difficulty in understanding how witch doctors could ever have existed, when nothing that 
they proposed ever really worked — or very little of it did. 

But even today I meet lots of people who sooner or later get me into a 
conversation about UFOs, or astrology, or some form of mysticism, expanded 
consciousness, new types of awareness, ESP, and so forth. And I've concluded that it's 
not a scientific world. 

Most people believe so many wonderful things that I decided to investigate why 



they did. And what has been referred to as my curiosity for investigation has landed me 
in a difficulty where I found so much junk that I'm overwhelmed. First I started out by 
investigating various ideas of mysticism, and mystic experiences. I went into isolation 
tanks and got many hours of hallucinations, so I know something about that. Then I went 
to Esalen, which is a hotbed of this kind of thought (it's a wonderful place; you should go 
visit there). Then I became overwhelmed. I didn’t realize how much there was. 

At Esalen there are some large baths fed by hot springs situated on a ledge about 
thirty feet above the ocean. One of my most pleasurable experiences has been to sit in 
one of those baths and watch the waves crashing onto the rocky shore below, to gaze into 
the clear blue sky above, and to study a beautiful nude as she quietly appears and settles 
into the bath with me. 

One time I sat down in a bath where there was a beautiful girl sitting with a guy 
who didn’t seem to know her. Right away I began thinking, "Gee! How am I gonna get 
started talking to this beautiful nude babe?" 

I'm trying to figure out what to say, when the guy says to her, "I’m, uh, studying 
massage. Could I practice on you?" 

"Sure," she says. They get out of the bath and she lies down on a massage table 

nearby. 

I think to myself, "What a nifty line! I can never think of anything like that!" He 
starts to rub her big toe. "I think I feel it," he says. "I feel a kind of dent — is that the pitui¬ 
tary?" 

I blurt out, "You're a helluva long way from the pituitary, man!" 

They looked at me, horrified — I had blown my cover — and said, "It's 
reflexology!" 

I quickly closed my eyes and appeared to be meditating. 

That’s just an example of the kind of things that overwhelm me. I also looked into 
extrasensory perception and PSI phenomena, and the latest craze there was Uri Geller, a 
man who is supposed to be able to bend keys by rubbing them with his finger. So I went 
to his hotel room, on his invitation, to see a demonstration of both mindreading and 
bending keys. He didn’t do any mindreading that succeeded; nobody can read my mind, I 
guess. And my boy held a key and Geller rubbed it, and nothing happened. Then he told 
us it works better under water, and so you can picture all of us standing in the bathroom 
with the water turned on and the key under it, and him rubbing the key with his finger. 
Nothing happened. So I was unable to investigate that phenomenon. 

But then I began to think, what else is there that we believe? (And I thought then 
about the witch doctors, and how easy it would have been to check on them by noticing 
that nothing really worked.) So I found things that even more people believe, such as that 
we have some knowledge of how to educate. There are big schools of reading methods 
and mathematics methods, and so forth, but if you notice, you'll see the reading scores 
keep going down — or hardly going up — in spite of the fact that we continually use these 
same people to improve the methods. There's a witch doctor remedy that doesn't work. It 
ought to be looked into; how do they know that their method should work? Another 
example is how to treat criminals. We obviously have made no progress — lots of theory, 
but no progress — in decreasing the amount of crime by the method that we use to handle 
criminals. 

Yet these things are said to be scientific. We study them. And I think ordinary 



people with commonsense ideas are intimidated by this pseudoscience. A teacher who 
has some good idea of how to teach her children to read is forced by the school system to 
do it some other way — or is even fooled by the school system into thinking that her 
method is not necessarily a good one. Or a parent of bad boys, after disciplining them in 
one way or another, feels guilty for the rest of her life because she didn’t do "the right 
thing," according to the experts. 

So we really ought to look into theories that don't work, and science that isn’t 
science. 

I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of 
what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of 
people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want 
the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged to make things like runways, to put 
fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two 
wooden pieces on his head l ik e headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out l ik e 
antennas — he's the controller — and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing 
everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it 
doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they 
follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing 
something essential, because the planes don’t land. 

Now it behooves me, of course, to tell you what they're missing. But it would be 
just about as difficult to explain to the South Sea Islanders how they have to arrange 
things so that they get some wealth in their system. It is not something simple like telling 
them how to improve the shapes of the earphones. But there is one feature I notice that is 
generally missing in cargo cult science. That is the idea that we all hope you have learned 
in studying science in school — we never explicitly say what this is, but just hope that you 
catch on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It is interesting, therefore, to 
bring it out now and speak of it explicitly. It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of 
scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty — a kind of leaning over 
backwards. For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that 
you think might make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it: other causes 
that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you've eliminated 
by some other experiment, and how they worked — to make sure the other fellow can tell 
they have been eliminated. 

Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know 
them. You must do the best you can — if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly 
wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, 
then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree 
with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to 
make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those 
things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the 
finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition. 

In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge 
the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one 
particular direction or another. 

The easiest way to explain this idea is to contrast it, for example, with advertising. 
Last night I heard that Wesson oil doesn’t soak through food. Well, that's true. It's not 



dishonest; but the thing I'm talking about is not just a matter of not being dishonest, it's a 
matter of scientific integrity, which is another level. The fact that should be added to that 
advertising statement is that no oils soak through food, if operated at a certain 
temperature. If operated at another temperature, they all will — including Wesson oil. So 
it's the implication which has been conveyed, not the fact, which is true, and the 
difference is what we have to deal with. 

We've learned from experience that the truth will come out. Other experimenters 
will repeat your experiment and find out whether you were wrong or right. Nature's 
phenomena will agree or they'll disagree with your theory. And, although you may gain 
some temporary fame and excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if 
you haven’t tried to be very careful in this kind of work. And it's this type of integrity, 
this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much of the 
research in cargo cult science. 

A great deal of their difficulty is, of course, the difficulty of the subject and the 
inapplicability of the scientific method to the subject. Nevertheless, it should be remarked 
that this is not the only difficulty. That's why the planes don’t land — but they don't land. 

We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of the ways we 
fool ourselves. One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experi¬ 
ment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. 
It's a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It's 
interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of the electron, after 
Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bigger than 
Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, and the next one's a little bit 
bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher. 

Why didn’t they discover that the new number was higher right away? It's a thing 
that scientists are ashamed of — this history — because it's apparent that people did things 
like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan's, they thought 
something must be wrong — and they would look for and find a reason why something 
might be wrong. When they got a number closer to Millikan's value they didn’t look so 
hard. And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like 
that. We've learned those tricks nowadays, and now we don’t have that kind of a disease. 

But this long history of learning how to not fool ourselves — of having utter 
scientific integrity — is, I'm sorry to say, something that we haven't specifically included 
in any particular course that I know of. We just hope you've caught on by osmosis. 

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest 
person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled 
yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional 
way after that. 

I would like to add something that's not essential to the science, but something I 
kind of believe, which is that you should not fool the layman when you're talking as a 
scientist. I am not trying to tell you what to do about cheating on your wife, or fooling 
your girlfriend, or something like that, when you're not trying to be a scientist, but just 
trying to be an ordinary human being. We’ll leave those problems up to you and your 
rabbi. I'm talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending 
over backwards to show how you're maybe wrong, that you ought to have when acting as 
a scientist. And this is our responsibility as scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I 



think to laymen. 

For example, I was a little surprised when I was talking to a friend who was going 
to go on the radio. He does work on cosmology and astronomy, and he wondered how he 
would explain what the applications of this work were. "Well," I said, "there aren’t any." 
He said, "Yes, but then we won't get support for more research of this kind." J think 
that's kind of dishonest. If you're representing yourself as a scientist, then you should 
explain to the layman what you’re doing — and if they don't want to support you under 
those circumstances, then that's their decision. 

One example of the principle is this: If you've made up your mind to test a theory, 
or you want to explain some idea, you should always decide to publish it whichever way 
it comes out. If we only publish results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look 
good. We must publish both kinds of results. 

I say that's also important in giving certain types of government advice. 

Supposing a senator asked you for advice about whether drilling a hole should be done in 
his state; and you decide it would be better in some other state. If you don’t publish such a 
result, it seems to me you're not giving scientific advice. You're being used. If your 
answer happens to come out in the direction the government or the politicians like, they 
can use it as an argument in their favor; if it comes out the other way, they don’t publish it 
at all. That's not giving scientific advice. 

Other kinds of errors are more characteristic of poor science. When I was at 
Cornell, I often talked to the people in the psychology department. One of the students 
told me she wanted to do an experiment that went something like this — it had been found 
by others that under certain circumstances, X, rats did something, A. She was curious as 
to whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they would still do A. So her proposal 
was to do the experiment under circumstances Y and see if they still did A. 

I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the 
experiment of the other person — to do it under condition X to see if she could also get 
result A, and then change to Y and see if A changed. Then she would know that the real 
difference was the thing she thought she had under control. 

She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor. And his 
reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has already been done and you 
would be wasting time. This was in about 1947 or so, and it seems to have been the 
general policy then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but only to change the 
conditions and see what happens. 

Nowadays there's a certain danger of the same thing happening, even in the 
famous field of physics. I was shocked to hear of an experiment done at the big 
accelerator at the National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In 
order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen with light hydrogen, 
he had to use data from someone else's experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on 
different apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn’t get time on the 
program (because there's so little time and it's such expensive apparatus) to do the 
experiment with light hydrogen on this apparatus because there wouldn’t be any new 
result. And so the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new results, in 
order to get more money to keep the thing going for public relations purposes, they are 
destroying — possibly — the value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole 
purpose of the thing. It is often hard for the experimenters there to complete their work as 



their scientific integrity demands. 

All experiments in psychology are not of this type, however. For example, there 
have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so on — with 
little clear result. But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one. He had a 
long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the 
other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the 
third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the 
door where the food had been the time before. 

The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully 
built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was 
something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors 
very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the 
rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used 
chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the 
rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like 
any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and still the rats could tell. 

He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran 
over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after 
another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn 
to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell. 

Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one experiment. That is 
the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers the clues 
that the rat is really using — not what you think it's using. And that is the experiment that 
tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything 
in an experiment with rat-running. 

I looked into the subsequent history of this research. The next experiment, and the 
one after that, never referred to Mr. Young. They never used any of his criteria of putting 
the corridor on sand, or being very careful. They just went right on running rats in the 
same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers 
are not referred to, because he didn’t discover anything about the rats. In fact, he 
discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats. But not paying 
attention to experiments like that is a characteristic of cargo cult science. 

Another example is the ESP experiments of Mr. Rhine, and other people. As 
various people have made criticisms — and they themselves have made criticisms of their 
own experiments — they improve the techniques so that the effects are smaller, and 
smaller, and smaller until they gradually disappear. All the parapsychologists are looking 
for some experiment that can be repeated — that you can do again and get the same effect 
— statistically, even. They run a million rats — no, it's people this time — they do a lot of 
things and get a certain statistical effect. Next time they try it they don’t get it any more. 
And now you find a man saying that it is an irrelevant demand to expect a repeatable 
experiment. This is science? 

This man also speaks about a new institution, in a talk in which he was resigning 
as Director of the Institute of Parapsychology. And, in telling people what to do next, he 
says that one of the things they have to do is be sure they only train students who have 
shown their ability to get PSI results to an acceptable extent — not to waste their time on 
those ambitious and interested students who get only chance results. It is very dangerous 



to have such a policy in teaching — to teach students only how to get certain results, 
rather than how to do an experiment with scientific integrity. 

So I have just one wish for you — the good luck to be somewhere where you are 
free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced 
by a need to maintain your position in the organization or financial support, or so on, to 
lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.
